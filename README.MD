# Note: this project is put on hold. I am working on a backend rewrite with (possibly) cross platform support. My current T-Deck has the keyboard broken off, and because of that i am planning on buying a t-deck plus, on which development will continue.
# Note 2: Instead of a T-Deck plus, i bought a t-watch because of unavailability in slovakia. The t-deck will maybe still be supported but added compatibility for watches will arrive
